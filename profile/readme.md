Hello there! This is [@kzu](https://github.com/kzu)'s (sounds like 'kah-zu' rather than 'kzoo' 😉) organization account 
where I publish projects I think might be useful to others and not just personal experiments. 

This is also the organization account you can actually [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) 
to support my ongoing opensource work.

## SponsorLink

I created [SponsorLink](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/) as a mechanism to remind users that they can 
sponsor my projects if they find them useful. It also allows attribution on the dev machine of a sponsorship 
to potentially unlock additional functionality (or just remove the reminder and thank instead!). SponsorLink 
never issues any messages outside of IDE usage, so it will never disrupt your CI/CD workflows or CLI builds.

If you arrived here from an IDE and are interested in sponsoring, the (one-time) steps are:

1. Select your [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) tier 🙏. 
   > If you are an [oss author](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/oss/), you don't have to
   sponsor me unless you want to 🫶. 
2. Install the [sponsor dotnet global tool](https://nuget.org/packages/dotnet-sponsor) by running
   ```shell
   dotnet tool install -g dotnet-sponsor
   ```
3. Sync your sponsorship status by running
   ```shell
   sponsor sync devlooped
   ```

Feel free to dive deeper into the [technical details](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github.html) of how 
this works. You can also implement SponsorLink yourself with minimal effort for your own projects.

### Implicit and Indirect Sponsorships

If you have ever sent a PR that was merged into any repository owned by [@devlooped](https://github.com/devlooped), 
you are considered an implicit sponsor already! Contributing your time and code is the most awesome way to support a project 🫶.

If you belong to an organization that sponsors [@devlooped](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped), then you are 
an indirect sponsor! This allows organizations to support projects their employees love and streamline invoicing.

Finally, if you are an open-source author or contributor yourself, chances are you are elegible for an implicit 
sponsorship I'll grant automatically! If your account shows up in the [OSS Authors](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/oss/), 
you can just sync your implicit sponsorship and continue enjoying my projects with no additional sponsorship needed. 
Contributing your valuable time to other projects is great too.

### AutoSync

Sponsorships are renewed monthly (even if paid anually), so your dev machine manifest needs monthly renewal too.
You can simplify this process by enabling [autosync](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/#auto-sync) 
so that the IDE tooling can automatically do this for you by checking at most once a day for expiration and running 
the same command you'd have to run manually: `sponsor sync devlooped`.
